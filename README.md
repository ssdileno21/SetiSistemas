Personal project built in Delphi
In mid-2016, I started a project in Delphi, with the intention of building a framework, to use it in solutions of different types. In parallel to the development, there were some urgent projects for 2 clients, I managed to finish and deliver, but there was a lack of several implements that I would like to do.
